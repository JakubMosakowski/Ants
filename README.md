## Introduction

Ants is a simple program for simulating anthill and ant behaviour. Ants are programmed to move around the board. When a leaf is encountered, ant lifts it up. After that it's taken to a queen. The game is finished after all leaves are taken by an ant.

## Help
When any bug is encountered, send me an e-mail - mosakowskijakubsm@gmail.com.
Using application on Windows is not supported. It should work, but the program wasn't optimised for windows and wasn't tested on that platform.

## Installation
### Requirements
Java Runtime Environment
### Installation
Download newest Ants.jar from releases. Unzip it.
How to start jar file example:
- java -jar Ants.jar

You can also download source code and compile it by yourself.
### Configuration
Click options button.
- Set ants. 
Set how many ants at maximum could be on board. Default and maximum value is 30. You can set any value from 1 to 30. 
- Set delay.
Set how many milliseconds between screen update. In short smaller value = ants are moving faster. Default is 200. You can set any value from 100 to 9999 (1000ms= 1 second).
- Set leaves.
Set how many leaves are spawned at the start of a game. Default value is 15. You can set any value from 1 to 30. 
Be careful! Ant can't collect more than one leaf!

To apply changes you have to click the Ok button and start new game e.g. click Start Again button.
