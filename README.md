## Introduction

"Ants" is a simple program which simulates anthill and ant behaviour. Ants are programmed to move around the board. When the ant moves to the field on which lay a leaf, the leaf is taken by an ant. After that, the leaf is taken to a queen. The game is finished after all leaves are taken by ants.

You can also change options by clicking Options' button.
<b/>Using application on Windows is not supported. It should work, but the program wasn't optimised for windows and wasn't tested on that platform.
